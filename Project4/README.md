# üåê Project 4: Three-Tier Distributed Web-Based Application

## Overview
This project is a **Java-based three-tier distributed web application** that integrates **Servlets, JSPs, JDBC, and MySQL** to simulate an enterprise-level system. Users log in with different credentials, which determine their access level and the type of operations they can perform. The system enforces business logic, manages a persistent database, and demonstrates full-stack enterprise application development.

## Features

**Multi-Tier Architecture**  
- **Front-End (Client):** HTML landing page for login, JSP pages for different user roles.  
- **Middle-Tier (Business Logic):** Java Servlets process requests, enforce rules, and interact with the database.  
- **Back-End (Database):** MySQL database (`project4`) storing suppliers, parts, jobs, and shipments.  

**User Roles**  
- **Root User:** Full access, including query/updates with business logic enforcement.  
- **Client User:** Read-only access (queries only).  
- **Data Entry User:** Can add/update records via parameterized `PreparedStatement`.  
- **Accountant User:** Runs stored procedures via `CallableStatement` for report generation.  

**Business Logic**  
- Automatically increments a supplier‚Äôs status by 5 when involved in a shipment with quantity ‚â• 100.  

**Database Structure**  
- **Suppliers:** `snum, sname, status, city`  
- **Parts:** `pnum, pname, color, weight, city`  
- **Jobs:** `jnum, jname, numworkers, city`  
- **Shipments:** `snum, pnum, jnum, quantity` (composite key with foreign keys)  

**Error Handling**  
- MySQL errors are caught and displayed in the GUI.  
- Invalid or unauthorized operations produce descriptive error messages.
