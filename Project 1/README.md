Nile Dot Com – Java E-Store Simulation
Project Overview

This project is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a simplified e-store called Nile Dot Com (a nod to Amazon.com). The application allows users to browse inventory, add items to a shopping cart, and generate an invoice upon checkout. It also maintains a transaction log for all purchases, simulating high-level enterprise e-commerce functionality.

Features

Inventory Management: Reads items from inventory.csv, which contains item ID, description, stock status, quantity on hand, and unit price.

Shopping Cart: Supports up to 5 unique items per transaction.

GUI Interface: Built using Java Swing, includes input fields, shopping cart display, and six main control buttons (search, add to cart, delete, checkout, reset, exit).

Error Handling: Displays message dialogs for out-of-stock items, insufficient stock, and invalid item IDs.

Checkout & Invoicing: Generates an order summary with subtotal, tax (6%), discounts (if applicable), and final total.

Transaction Logging: Appends each transaction to transactions.csv, uniquely identified by a date/time-based transaction ID.

Files

inventory.csv – Input file containing store inventory.

transactions.csv – Output log file storing all completed transactions.

*.java – Source files implementing the GUI and application logic.

Deliverables

Executable GUI application.
